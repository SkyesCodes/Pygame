# Fruit Slicer!
### It is your final phase of chef training, you must make a fruit salad as your estranged instructor sends the fruit flying your way! Careful to avoid the bombs he mixed in! You will have 3 lives to score as many points as you can, good luck!

## Game Description
- The objective of this game is to click fruits as they fly across the screen and near your character, timing and accuracy are the name of the game here.
- Clicking fruit will score you points
- Clicking bombs will lose a life 
- You have 3 lives to score as many points as possible
- You will have 5 minutes to score as many points as possible
- there is no win condition, only loss and time out conditions, the objective is to score as high as possible and try to beat it on later attempts.

## User Stories
- AAU I want to click start and have the game begin
- AAU I want to be able to play the game have it tracking my points and lives correctly
- AAU I want to play the game to beat my own highscore

## MVP
- A working pygame, including a start screen
- render a character on the screen 
- render fruits and bombs to move across the screen
- make either the area the fruit is in, or the fruit themselves clickable, as well as bombs. 
- Game will track score
- Will track lives, ending the game when you run out of them.
- Game will end after a 5 minute timer to allow for highscore attempts, but no run endlessly


## Stretch goals
- Include normal and hard difficulties, which will make the game both more accesible and have a higher ceiling 
- Focus on visual styling hopefully including animations and sounds
- attach to a database to have scores globally tracked on deployment
- Create a highscore display on start screen
- alter the loss condition to make accuracy more important, missing fruit will also lose a life.
- create combo tracking to further reward accuracy and highscore opportunities. (alternative to the altered loss condition)

## Sprint Plan:
- Wednesday
    - Continue learning to use pygame through reading, videos, and hands on testing
- Thursday
    - Begin initial barebones of the game visuals so I can add logic to them and see it work
- Friday
    - Work on the game logic (this is expected to take the longest)
- Weekend
    - Finish game logic
- Monday
    - If game logic is not complete, complete it. If it is, move on to stretch goals
- Tuesday
    -hopefully stretch goals
- Wednesday
    -hopefully stretch goals
- Thursday
    -Present!
